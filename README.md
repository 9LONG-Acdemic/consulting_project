## Project Description
This comprehensive report for MINGAR investigates the market dynamics and product performance of their fitness tracking devices. Through statistical analysis, it contrasts the attributes of new and traditional customers, particularly focusing on how income levels and age influence customer segments. Additionally, the report addresses potential performance discrepancies in sleep tracking for users with different skin tones, identifying significant differences in device performance based on skin color. The insights derived aim to inform MINGAR's strategic decisions, ensuring product enhancements and targeted marketing strategies.
